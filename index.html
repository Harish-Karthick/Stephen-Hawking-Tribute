          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Stephen Hawking's life:</h3>

          <li><strong>8 January 1942</strong> - Hawking was born in Oxford, England</li>

          <li><strong>1959</strong> - Hawking attended University College, Oxford</li>

          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Hawking recieved first-class BA (Hons.)degree in physics and began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.</li>

          <li><strong>1966</strong> - Hawking's thesis about the creation of the universe by big bang was approved and he won Adams prize for his essay "Singularities and the geometry of Space-time"</li>

          <li><strong>1968</strong> - In collaboration with Roger Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts and included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that universe might have started as a singularity</li>

          <li><strong>1970</strong> - Hawking postulated second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.</li>

          <li><strong>1973</strong> - Hawking published his first book "The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time"</li>

          <li><strong>1975</strong> - Hawking was awarded with the Eddington Medal and the Plus XI Gold Medal.</li>

          <li><strong>1977</strong> - Hawking was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in Cambridge University.</li>

          <li><strong>1979</strong> - Hawking was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. His inaugural lecture in this role was titled: "Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?" and proposed N=8 Supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.</li>

          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>

          <li><strong>1981</strong> - Hawking proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including "the Black Hole War" with Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft.</li>

          <li><strong>1985</strong> - Hawking published a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.</li>

          <li><strong>1993</strong> - Hawking co-edited a book on Eculidean quantum gravity with gary gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the big bang.</li>

          <li><strong>1997</strong> - Hawking conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a "cosmic censorship conjecture" – that there could be no "naked singularities" unclothed within a horizon – was correct.</li>

          <li><strong>2001</strong> - Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, Publishing The universe in a nutshell.</li>

          <li><strong>2007</strong> - Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key to the Universe, a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the hawking family.</li>

          <li><strong>2009</strong> - Hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party.</li>
          
          <li><strong>2018</strong> - Hawking published his final paper A smooth exit from eternal inflation in Journal of High Energy Physics.</li>

          <li><strong>14 March 2018</strong> - Hawking passed away at the age of 76.</li>

        </ul>
